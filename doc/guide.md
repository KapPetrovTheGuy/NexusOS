# GUIDE
This is a guide into how to use the system.

# First Time Boot Up
Once you boot up the computer, you will see a screen saying "CLICK TO OPEN GUI", Simple way to get rid of this is just move your mouse
or left click or right click.

# Desktop
Once you get to the desktop, you see a bright cyan screen with a black box. The black box is our mouse.

Once you open it, like it says in the window, Press "C" On your keyboard To Close the window.
